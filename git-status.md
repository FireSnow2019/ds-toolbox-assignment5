**Definition: git status**
The git status command in Git is used to display the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows you which changes have been staged, which have not, and which files are not being tracked by Git. The following are some examples 

***Untracked Files***:

These are files in your working directory that are not being tracked by Git. These are modifications to tracked files that have not yet been staged. In other words, you have edited these files,but you have not yet used git add to mark them for inclusion in the next commit.

***Changes to Be Committed***:

These are changes that have been added to the staging area using git add and will be included in the next commit. This includes new files, modified files, and deleted files that have been staged.

***Branch Information***:

The command also displays information about current branch you are on, such as the branch name and whether your branch is ahead, behind, or has diverged from the remote branch.
